# Getting Started with Syntha

Welcome to Syntha! This guide will take you on a step-by-step journey to master context-based multi-agent systems. By the end, you'll understand how to build secure, scalable agent workflows that share information intelligently.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Add Context to Any Agent in 60 Seconds

Want to see Syntha in action right now? Here's how to add context superpowers to any existing agent:

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh, ToolHandler

# Step 1: Create context (with user isolation!)
context = ContextMesh(user_id="your_user_id", enable_persistence=True)

# Step 2: Create a tool handler for your agent
handler = ToolHandler(context, agent_name="YourAgent")

# Step 3: Get tools to give your LLM
tools = handler.get_schemas()

# That's it! Your agent now has:
# - Persistent memory across conversations
# - Ability to share context with other agents  
# - Smart caching and context discovery
# - Complete user isolation for security

print(f"Your agent now has {len(tools)} context management tools!")
```

**What just happened?**

1. **Context Creation**: Created an isolated context space for your user
2. **Tool Integration**: Generated context management tools for your agent
3. **Instant Enhancement**: Your agent can now remember, share, and discover context

**Next**: Add these tools to your existing LLM framework (OpenAI, LangChain, etc.) and watch your agent become context-aware!

## What You'll Learn

These guides are designed as **tutorials**, not reference documentation. Each section builds on the previous one with working examples you can copy and run immediately. You'll learn:

1. **Core Concepts** - How context sharing works and why user isolation matters
2. **Basic Patterns** - Simple context sharing between agents  
3. **Advanced Routing** - Topic-based vs subscription-based context routing
4. **Tools & Permissions** - How agents interact with context and access control
5. **Real-World Integration** - Complete examples with OpenAI and other LLMs

## The Big Picture: Why Syntha Exists

Traditional multi-agent systems struggle with:

- **Information Silos**: Agents can't share knowledge effectively
- **Security Risks**: No isolation between different users
- **Complex Coordination**: Manual agent-to-agent communication
- **Inconsistent State**: No single source of truth

Syntha solves these problems with a **Context Mesh** - a shared knowledge layer where:

- Agents push and pull context automatically
- Users are completely isolated from each other
- Information routes intelligently based on topics or direct targeting
- Everything persists across sessions

## User Isolation: The Foundation

**🔐 Critical Security Principle**: Every production deployment MUST use user isolation.

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh

# ✅ CORRECT - Each user gets their own isolated context
user1_context = ContextMesh(user_id="user_123")
user2_context = ContextMesh(user_id="user_456")

# ❌ DANGEROUS - All users share the same context (security risk!)
shared_context = ContextMesh()  # No user_id!
```

**Why this matters:**

- **Privacy**: Users can't see each other's data
- **Security**: Prevents accidental data leaks
- **Compliance**: Meets GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection requirements
- **Scalability**: Clean separation enables better performance

## Two Ways to Route Context

Syntha provides two powerful routing mechanisms:

### Topic-Based Routing (Recommended)
Agents subscribe to topics they care about, and context automatically routes to interested parties.

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh

context = ContextMesh(user_id="user123")
# Agents declare their interests
context.register_agent_topics("SalesAgent", ["sales", "customers"])
context.register_agent_topics("SupportAgent", ["support", "customers"])

# Push context to topics - all subscribers automatically receive it
customer_data = {"name": "Acme Corp", "value": 50000}
context.push("new_customer", customer_data, topics=["customers"])
```

**Best for**: Scalable workflows, agent-to-agent communication, broadcast scenarios

### Subscription-Based Routing (For Private Communication)
Context goes directly to specific named agents.

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh

context = ContextMesh(user_id="user123")
# Private communication between specific agents
secret_data = {"api_key": "sk-abc123", "endpoint": "https://api.example.com"}
context.push("api_credentials", secret_data, subscribers=["AuthAgent", "AdminAgent"])
```

**Best for**: Sensitive information, private coordination, direct messaging

## Two Ways to Use Context

### 1. Tool-Based Integration (Agents Control Context)
Agents actively manage context through function calls:

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh, ToolHandler

context = ContextMesh(user_id="user123")
handler = ToolHandler(context, "MyAgent")
result = handler.handle_tool_call("subscribe_to_topics", topics=["sales"])
result = handler.handle_tool_call("push_context", key="data", value="info", topics=["sales"])
```

**Advantages:**

- Agents have full control
- Dynamic topic management  
- Works with any LLM supporting function calling
- Scales well with complex workflows

### 2. Prompt-Based Integration (Context Injected Automatically)
Context automatically appears in agent prompts:

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh, build_system_prompt

context = ContextMesh(user_id="user123")
system_prompt = build_system_prompt("MyAgent", context)
# Prompt now includes all accessible context
```

**Advantages:**

- Simple integration
- Works with any LLM (even without function calling)
- Transparent to agents
- Good for simple scenarios

## What Each Tool Does

When you give tools to agents, here's what each one is for:

| Tool | **For Users** | **For AI Agents** |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| `get_context` | Retrieve specific data | Get context they need for current task |
| `list_context` | See what's available | **Discover what context exists** (avoids pulling everything) |
| `push_context` | Share information | Share results/findings with other agents |
| `subscribe_to_topics` | Join conversations | **Subscribe to relevant information streams** |
| `discover_topics` | Find active topics | **Find what topics exist and who's subscribed** |
| `unsubscribe_from_topics` | Leave conversations | Stop receiving updates from topics |
| `delete_topic` | Clean up | Remove entire topics (admin only) |

**Key Insight**: `list_context` is crucial for AI efficiency. It lets agents see what's available without pulling all context (which wastes tokens). They can then selectively use `get_context` for only what they need.

## Persistence: Only Context Mesh Needed

**Simple Rule**: Use Context Mesh persistence instead of separate databases.

```python
from syntha import ContextMesh

# ✅ RECOMMENDED - Context Mesh handles persistence
context = ContextMesh(
    user_id="user123",
    enable_persistence=True,
    db_backend="sqlite",  # or "postgresql" 
    db_path="context.db"
)
```

**Why**: Context Mesh already handles:

- User isolation
- TTL (time-to-live) expiration
- Topic-based routing
- Access control

Adding a separate database creates complexity without benefits.

## Roles and Permissions: When You Need Them

**Simple Answer**: Most applications don't need complex permissions.

**Use roles when**:

- Different agents should have different capabilities
- You want to prevent agents from deleting topics
- You need audit trails of who did what
- You have untrusted or experimental agents
- You want to save tokens/agent complexity (less tools means less bloated)

**Available roles**:

- `readonly`: Can only view context and discover topics
- `contributor`: Can read, write, and manage subscriptions  
- `moderator`: Contributor + can manage others' subscriptions
- `admin`: Full access including destructive operations

```python
# Only give delete permissions to trusted agents
admin_handler = create_role_based_handler(context, "AdminAgent", "admin")
worker_handler = create_role_based_handler(context, "WorkerAgent", "contributor")
```

**Skip permissions if**: All your agents are trusted and you want simplicity.
